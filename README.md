# Hello, I'm Davis Shoup !
I'm a developer currently in a Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly. 


- I have a passion for problem solving and creativity. The joy of seeing a project come together is so rewarding. I love being able to take an idea and bring it to life with working software.
- I'm currently utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I'm eager to learn React and Python.
- I'm currently learning about jQuery and utilizing API's.
